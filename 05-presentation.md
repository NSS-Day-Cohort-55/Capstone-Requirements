# Demo Day Front-End Capstones

1. Demos will start at 9:00 AM.
1. You will have a presentation order
1. During the demo, tell a story with your app
1. You will have 5 minutes to demo your capstone. If you have a lot of features, you will need to plan exactly the path you’ll take and which features you will and won’t show.
1. You should have a user already logged in and ready to go; don’t waste time showing a register/login sequence. If you have an awesome landing page that you want to demo, logout at the end of your demo and end the presentation on that view.
1. You should have real data (avoid `test`, `test`, `test`, etc.)
1. Before demo day make sure to test out any audio or video that will be a part of your presentation.
1. You will only be showing the product, not the code. Close the browser developer tools during the demo.
1. Turn off notifications when you are sharing your screen
1. A slideshow is required for demo day
1. There will NOT be Q&A on demo day

## Slideshow should include:
- The name of your app
- A description of your app
- The objectives of your app (What does it do? Who is it for? What is the problem you are solving?)
- `Time for a live demo!` (a reminder when you are nervous)
- Tech stack list (optional -- but if you do include it, don't read it. Highlight those special technologies.
- Lessons Learned

## Important points to remember:
* Use a tool to assist preparing your presentation (Google Docs has slides).
* Speak loudly and clearly, and face your audience.
* Be positive and use positive words. DO NOT emphasize broken parts of the program. If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
* DO NOT insult your own work. People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
* Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned". Your presentation should stand alone.
* Practice your presentation.
* Your presentation and application should be complete the evening before presentations. 
* Give your attention on the presenter during the presentations.
